#include <stdio.h>
//main function
int main(void)
{
printf("Hello World! \n);
return 0;
Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
}
